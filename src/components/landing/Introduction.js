                The dashboard below presents data from a set of socio-economic response 
                monitoring indicators that emanated from the UN framework for the immediate 
                response to the socio-economic impact of COVID-19. This dashboard followed the 
                call from the Secretary-General’s to develop a "… single, consolidated dashboard 
                to provide up-to-date visibility on [COVID-19] activities and progress across all 
                pillars”. The indicators monitor the progress and achievements of UNCT’s 
                collective actions in socio-economic response. Together with the indicators 
                monitoring the health and humanitarian responses, and the indicators monitoring the
                human rights impact of COVID-19, they make up the core basis for the UN system’s 
                indicator framework for COVID-19.
